This document describes the steps involved to run the 360d app using the docker image.

After cloning the project, download videos from https://nvidia.app.box.com/s/ezzw0js1ti555vbn3swsggvepcsh3x7e and place it in a directory named `videos` inside `perception_docker`.

1) Execute the run.sh command

2) When the container starts up, edit config file to set broker url (if required).
To do so first install and editor (eg: nano)
  $ apt-get update
  $ apt-get install nano

3) enable logging (optional)

~# DeepStream360d_Release/sources/tools/nvds_logger/setup_nvds_logger.sh 

Note: the log severity level can be edited in the setup script if desired
-- set to 7 if logging of entire messages is required

4) run the 360d app
Eg:
~# deepstream-360d-app -c DeepStream360d_Release/samples/configs/deepstream-360d-app/source10_gpu0.txt 


Note: if there is an error that looks like below, then the broker address is not valid.

ERROR from nvmsgbroker: Could not configure supporting library.
Debug info: gstnvmsgbroker.c(325): gst_nvmsgbroker_start (): /GstPipeline:pipeline/GstNvMsgBroker:nvmsgbroker:
